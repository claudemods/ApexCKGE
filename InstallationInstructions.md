installation methods 


login as root since my home files wont exist until you execute the.sh
if you plan to use from sdd/hdd 
navigate to /opt/btrfs-installer/drive1and2/btrfsgenfstab.sh or /opt/btrfs-installer/drive1and2/btrfsgenfstab.sh
reboot and login as usual my theme and stuff will be available


Default advised installation method currently broken 
but will install .img on partition 1 and system on partion 3 and 4


Secondary Advised Method Iso
ive been doing alot of building, tinkering and testing lately nothing has been stable
the aim is to build a iso for downloading and installing the .imgs
